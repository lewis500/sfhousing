Over the past six months, San Francisco's housing prices and apartment rents have spawned coverage and editorials in Bloomberg, Wall Street Journal, New York Times and the Atlantic.  The consensus in the editorial pages has been that permitting and land use regulations keep supply from catching up to demand. For example, Ed Glaeser, Professor of Economics at Harvard University, has spent years studying land use controls, and he recently wrote in the Times: "The best way to make cities more affordable is to reduce the barriers to building and unleash the cranes." San Francisco Mayor Ed Lee appears to agree. Announcing his affordable housing plan, Lee said remarked, "We are all responsible - this is a crisis of our own making." He plans to permit 30,000 housing units over the next six years...an average of 5,000 per year. This is certainly much faster than San Francisco has been building housing.

Will it have an impact, though? 30,000 sounds like a big number, but San Francisco already has about 378,000 housing units, so over six years it only means a 1.2% annual rate of growth. The projected 5,000 units per year amounts to just three quarters of the 6,600 units built in the City of Seattle in 2013.

Another issue you hear a lot about is the Ellis Act, which allows landlords to evict tenants and convert their apartments to "Tenancy-In-Common" condiminium complexes. Ellis Act evictions can certainly be heartwrenching, but there are so few that it is impossible they influence housing prices.

The thing to remember is that San Francisco is part of a metropolitan area, and the dozens of cities overlap in one giant market for living space. On the chart below, you'll see the San Francisco-Oakland-Fremont Metropolitan Statitical Area (MSA) compared to other MSA's around the country. San Francisco and Boston are metros that restrict construction and have seen huge price rises. Dallas and Charlotte don't subsantially restrict construction and have stable, low housing prices. Finally, Seattle and Portland are metros with heavy land use regulation (both have urban growth coundaries) but enough construction to temper housing prices.
